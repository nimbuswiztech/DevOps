SonarQube is an open-source static testing analysis software, it is used by developers to manage source code quality and consistency.
## 🧰 Prerequisites

Source: https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/requirements/requirements/
1. An EC2 instance with a minimum of 2 GB RAM (t2.small)  
1. Java 21 installation   
   ```sh 
   sudo yum install java-21-amazon-corretto-devel -y
   ```
1. SonarQube cannot be run as root on Unix-based systems, so create a dedicated user account for SonarQube if necessary.

## Installation steps

   cd /opt/sonarqube-x.x/bin/linux-x86-64   
   ./sonar.sh start
   ```
3. Connect to the SonarQube server through the browser. It uses port 9000.

   ```sh 
   cd /opt/sonarqube-x.x/bin/linux-x86-64 
   ./sonar.sh stop
   ```
